# Magnetic Levitation System Modeling
## Introduction
Magnetic levitation is a remarkable technique that utilizes the power of magnetic fields to defy gravity and suspend objects in mid-air. A prominent illustration of its practical implementation is the maglev train, which capitalizes on this levitating effect to minimize friction and achieve remarkable speeds.
